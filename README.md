Hi this is my PROG6221 project.

#### Project Overview

This Recipe Management App allows users to enter details of a cooking recipe, which includes ingredients and preparation steps. The application supports scaling the recipe quantities by different factors and provides functionality to reset or clear the recipe data.

#### Features

- **Enter Recipe Details**: Users can input the number of ingredients, their names, quantities, units of measurement, and detailed step-by-step instructions.
